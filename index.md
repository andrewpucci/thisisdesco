## OUR MISSION
Our goal is to provide a community in Sacramento for diverse individuals like ourselves. We welcome those from all fields and backgrounds who are interested in design and design thinking.

We specialize in these areas: UX, UI, illustration, web design, photography, typography & lettering, graphic design, branding, and beyond.

We want to create an environment that fosters learning and discussion around design and its related topics. Our community is a safe and inclusive space, online and in person, where people of all skill levels can collaborate, exchange ideas, learn, receive feedback, maintain accountability, and network.

Our collective encourages the intersection of technology and interdisciplinary studies. We approach design from a standpoint of modernity and practicality, and hope to work together to improve the overall quality of the craft.
