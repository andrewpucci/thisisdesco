## MISSION STATEMENT

Our goal is to provide a community in Sacramento for diverse individuals like ourselves. We welcome those from all fields and backgrounds who are interested in design and design thinking. 

Areas that we specialize in: UX, UI, illustration, web design, photography, typography & lettering, graphic design, branding, and beyond.

## What do we do?

We have created an environment that fosters learning and discussion around design and its related topics. Our community is a safe and inclusive space, online and in person, where people of all skill levels can collaborate, exchange ideas, learn, receive feedback, maintain accountability, and network.

Our collective encourages the intersection technology and interdisciplinary studies. We approach design from a standpoint of modernity and practicality and hope to work together to improve the overall quality of the craft.

## Why do we do it?

Unsure of which path to follow next? Seeking feedback on that project you’ve been working on for months? Looking for motivation and accountability?

So are we! 

We know how isolating it is to be new to the field, a freelancer, or the sole designer at your firm. We’ve been there!
Sacramento is full of creatives but lacks organized support for people in these fields. We decided to do something about it and established the kind of space that we were looking for.
